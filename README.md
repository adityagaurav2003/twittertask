⚙️ **Tech Stack**

- 🟦 **Node.js** – Backend runtime for server logic  
- ⚡ **Express.js** – Handles HTTP requests and SSE connections  
- 🔗 **Socket.io** – Real-time, event-based communication  
- 🐦 **Twitter API v2** – API for managing and posting tweets  
- 🔒 **OAuth 1.0a** – Secure authentication with Twitter  
- 🪄 **Google Gemini** – AI-powered tweet suggestions  
- 📜 **Zod** – Validation for API data  
- 🚀 **Docker** – Easy deployment & consistent environments

💻 **How It Works**

1️⃣ **User Authenticates** – Uses OAuth 1.0a to securely connect their Twitter account.  
2️⃣ **Create Post** – User submits a post request to the backend server.  
3️⃣ **Validation** – The server uses **Zod** to validate tweet content and metadata.  
4️⃣ **Live Feedback** – SSE streams live status updates (success, error, or Gemini AI suggestion) directly to the user’s browser.  
5️⃣ **AI-Powered Suggestions** – Google Gemini generates smarter tweet suggestions for engaging content.  
6️⃣ **Final Posting** – The tweet is posted to Twitter via Twitter API v2.

👉 Visit the client app to connect and start streaming your tweets!

🔒 Security & Deployment Notes

⚠️ Use environment variables or a secure .env file for sensitive keys (never hardcode!).
⚠️ Add authentication & rate limiting for production deployments.
⚠️ Consider containerizing with Docker for consistent deployment environments.
